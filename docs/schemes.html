  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    We sometimes hear that schemes generalize varieties. But when seeing the
    construction of schemes, this may not be directly obvious. In this post,
    we explain how we get to this result and how one should therefore view schemes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \( K \) be an algebraically closed field. We will mostly base our study
    on Gathmann's notes and we will often refer to it.
  </p>

  <h3>Goal</h3>

  <p>
    The key observation for the upcoming generalization is the following:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Observation.</strong> By remark 4.16, we have a bijection</p>

  \[
    \frac{\{\text{affine varieties over } K\}}{\cong}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \frac{\{\text{finitely generated reduced } K\text{-algebras}\}}{\cong}
  \]
  \[
    X \longmapsto A(X)
  \]

  <p>
    Given a field \( K \), affine varieties are the same as finitely generated
    reduced \( K \)-algebras. It is thus very natural to leverage this
    correspondence to generalize (affine) varieties: can we construct an object
    that is in correspondence with rings in general, and that corresponds to
    varieties in the particular case of finitely generated reduced
    \( K \)-algebras?
  </p>

  <h3>Idea</h3>

  <p>
    So how does this correspondence actually work?
  </p>

  <p>
    Its core idea is: instead of looking at varieties as the set of its points,
    let's view it as the set of its subvarieties.
  </p>

  <h2>Reformulations of affine varieties</h2>

  <p>
    So let's try to reformulate our construction of affine varieties as ringed
    spaces but with this new viewpoint on them.
  </p>

  <h3>As sets</h3>

  <p>
    As sets, we said that we will focus on the set
  </p>

  \[
    X_{\mathrm{sch}} := \{ Y : Y \text{ affine irreducible subvariety of } X \}
  \]

  <p>
    instead of just \( X \). One way to see this pass from one to the other is
  </p>

  \[
    X = \bigcup_{\substack{Y \text{ irreducible} \\ \text{affine s.v. of } X}} Y
    \;\leadsto\;
    \{ Y : Y \text{ irreducible affine s.v. of } X \}.
  \]

  <h3>As topological spaces</h3>

  <p>
    Now let's give this set a topology inspired by what we have done so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the case of affine varieties, a closed subset is one given by
  </p>

  \[
    C = \bigcup_{\substack{Y \subseteq C,\ \text{affine} \\
    \text{irreducible}}} Y
  \]

  <p>
    where \( C \) is affine. So mimicking \( \leadsto \), we can simply define
    closed subsets of \( X_{\mathrm{sch}} \) as those of the form
  </p>

  \[
    \{ Y : Y \subseteq Y_0,\ Y \text{ affine irreducible} \}
  \]

  <p>
    for \( Y_0 \) affine (not necessarily irreducible).
  </p>

  <p>
    We can show that this defines a topology.
  </p>

  <h3>As ringed spaces</h3>

  <p>
    Now we want to define a regular function on an open subset of
    \( X_{\mathrm{sch}} \).
  </p>

  <p>
    On \( U \subseteq X \) open, a regular function is a "local" rational function
    on \( U \) satisfying
  </p>

  \[
    \forall x \in U\quad \exists f,g \in A(X),\ x \in U_x \subseteq U :
    \forall y \in U_x,\ f(y) \neq 0,\ \varphi(y) = \frac{g(y)}{f(y)}.
  \]

  <p>
    So now we want to define a regular function on some set of irreducible affine
    varieties of the form
  </p>

  \[
    U_0 = \{ Y : Y \nsubseteq Y_0,\ Y \text{ irreducible affine} \}.
  \]

  <p>
    The most natural idea is to say that a function on a set of irreducible affine
    varieties is a set of functions on each irreducible affine variety.
    Therefore we will consider on \( U_0 \) objects of the form
    \( (\varphi_Y)_{Y \in U_0} \).
  </p>

  <p>
    But what is \( \varphi_{Y'} \) exactly? In analogy, it corresponds to
    \( \varphi(y) \).
  </p>

  <p>
    Evaluating a regular function at a point should be the same as looking at its
    class in the stalk around that point. We have proven that the stalk at \( Y \)
    is \( A(X)_{I(Y)} \).
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus we define
  </p>

  \[
    \varphi_Y \in A(X)_{I(Y)}.
  \]

  <p>
    We then have the definition: for all \( Y \in U \),
  </p>

  \[
    \exists f,g \in A(X),\ Y \in U_Y \subseteq U :
    \forall Y' \in U_Y,\ f \notin I(Y'),\ 
    \varphi_Y = \frac{g}{f} \in A(X)_{I(Y')}.
  \]

  <h3>Regular functions as functions</h3>

  <p>
    We may now use this to refine our perception of the elements of the ring as
    functions.
  </p>

  \[
    \mathrm{Frac}(R/\mathfrak{p}) = R_{\mathfrak{p}}.
  \]

  <p>
    By defining \( f(\mathfrak{p}) = \overline{f}/1 \in R_{\mathfrak{p}} \), we get
    \( f(\mathfrak{p}) = 0 \iff f \in \mathfrak{p} \), hence
  </p>

  \[
    \{ \mathfrak{p} : f(\mathfrak{p}) = 0 \}
    =
    \{ \mathfrak{p} : f \in \mathfrak{p} \}
    =
    V(f).
  \]

  <p>
    Therefore with this definition of evaluation, we recover the Zariski
    topology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, the sheaf we have defined is the sheafification of the presheaf of
    rational functions, exactly as in the affine case.
  </p>
