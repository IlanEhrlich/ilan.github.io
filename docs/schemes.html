<h2>Introduction3</h2>

<p>
We sometimes hear that schemes generalize varieties. But when seeing the construction
of schemes, this may not be directly obvious. In this post, we explain how we get to
this result and how one should therefore view schemes.
</p>

<p>
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field. We will mostly base our study on Gathmann's
notes and we will often refer to it.
</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>
The key observation for the upcoming generalization is the following:
</p>

<p><strong>Observation.</strong> By remark 4.16, we have a bijection</p>

$$
\frac{\{\text{affine varieties over } K\}}{\cong}
\longleftrightarrow
\frac{\{\text{finitely generated reduced } K\text{-algebras}\}}{\cong}
$$

$$
X \longmapsto A(X)
$$

<p>
Given a field $K$, affine varieties are the same as finitely generated reduced
$K$-algebras. It is thus very natural to leverage this correspondence to generalize
(affine) varieties: can we construct an object that is in correspondence with rings
in general, and that corresponds to varieties in the particular case of finitely
generated reduced $K$-algebras?
</p>

<h3>Idea</h3>

<p>
So how does this correspondence actually work?
</p>

<p>
Its core idea is: instead of looking at varieties as the set of its points, let us
view it as the set of its subvarieties.
</p>

<h2>Reformulations of affine varieties</h2>

<p>
So let us try to reformulate our construction of affine varieties as ringed spaces
but with this new viewpoint on them.
</p>

<h3>As sets</h3>

<p>
As sets, we said that we will focus on the set
</p>

$$
X_{\mathrm{sch}}
:= \{ Y : Y \text{ affine irreducible subvariety of } X \}
$$

<p>
instead of just $X$. One way to see this pass from one to the other is
</p>

$$
X
=
\bigcup_{\substack{Y \text{ irreducible} \\
\text{affine s.v. of } X}} Y
\;\leadsto\;
\{ Y : Y \text{ irr. affine s.v. of } X \}.
$$

<h3>As topological spaces</h3>

<p>
Now let us give this set a topology inspired by what we have done so far.
</p>

<p>
In the case of affine varieties, a closed subset is one given by
</p>

$$
C =
\bigcup_{\substack{Y \subseteq C,\ \text{affine} \\
\text{irreducible}}} Y
$$

<p>
where $C$ is affine. So mimicking the arrow above, we can simply define closed subsets
of $X_{\mathrm{sch}}$ as those of the form
</p>

$$
\{ Y : Y \subseteq Y_0,\ Y \text{ affine irreducible} \}
$$

<p>
for $Y_0$ affine (not necessarily irreducible).
</p>

<p>
We can show that this defines a topology.
</p>

<h3>As ringed spaces</h3>

<p>
Now we want to define a regular function on an open subset of $X_{\mathrm{sch}}$.
On $U \subseteq X$ open, a regular function is a local rational function on $U$
satisfying
</p>

$$
\forall x \in U\quad
\exists f,g \in A(X),\ x \in U_x \subseteq U:
\forall y \in U_x,\ f(y) \neq 0,\ 
\varphi(y) = \frac{g(y)}{f(y)}.
$$

<p>
So now we want to define a regular function on some set of irreducible affine
varieties of the form
</p>

$$
U_0
=
\{ Y : Y \nsubseteq Y_0,\ Y \text{ irreducible affine} \}.
$$

<p>
The most natural idea is to say that a function on a set of irreducible affine
varieties is a set of functions on each irreducible affine variety. Therefore we
will consider on $U_0$ objects of the form $(\varphi_Y)_{Y \in U_0}$.
</p>

<p>
But what is $\varphi_{Y'}$ exactly? ($Y'$ being a point that is not the base point
called $Y$ but one in its neighborhood $U_Y$.) In analogy, it corresponds to
$\varphi(y)$.
</p>

<p>
First, we know that it must be well-defined on the neighborhood of $x$, i.e.
$f(y) \neq 0$ for all $y \in U_X$. The way to generalize this is either
</p>

$$
0 \notin f(Y')
\quad \text{or} \quad
f(Y') \neq \{0\}.
$$

<p>
The first corresponds to defining $\varphi_{Y'}$ as a quotient of polynomials and the
second as a rational function. The first seems more appropriate, but this is not the
best conceptual way of seeing this.
</p>

<p>
Rather, note that evaluating a regular function at a point should be the same as
looking at its class in the stalk around that point. Yet, we have proven in Lemma
3.19 that the stalk is the local ring $A(X)_{I(x)}$, where $I(x)$ is the ideal of
polynomials vanishing at $x$.
</p>

<p>
So the way to generalize this is, as in Exercise 3.23, to consider the evaluation of
$\varphi$ at $Y$ (i.e. $\varphi_Y$) as an element of the stalk at $Y$, which we have
proven to be equal to $A(X)_{I(Y)}$. The second option can be written as
$f \notin I(Y)$, which is the exact generalization in light of our conclusions on
stalks.
</p>

<p>
So $\varphi_Y$ is a rational function on the open neighborhood around $Y$, i.e. a
quotient of two polynomials, the denominator not completely vanishing on $Y$:
</p>

$$
\varphi_Y \in A(X)_{I(Y)}.
$$

<p>
We then have the definition: for all $Y \in U$,
</p>

$$
\exists f,g \in A(X),\ Y \in U_Y \subseteq U:
\forall Y' \in U_Y,\ f \notin I(Y'),\
\varphi_{Y'} = \frac{g}{f} \in A(X)_{I(Y')}.
$$

<p><strong>Regular functions as functions.</strong></p>

<p>
We may now use this to refine our perception of the elements of the ring as
functions.
</p>

<p>
Note that
</p>

$$
\mathrm{Frac}(R/\mathfrak{p}) = R_{\mathfrak{p}}.
$$

<p>
By defining $f(\mathfrak{p}) = \overline{f}/1 \in \mathrm{Frac}(R/\mathfrak{p}) =
R_{\mathfrak{p}}$, we get
</p>

$$
f(\mathfrak{p}) = 0 \iff f \in \mathfrak{p},
$$

<p>
so
</p>

$$
\{ \mathfrak{p} : f(\mathfrak{p}) = 0 \}
=
\{ \mathfrak{p} : f \in \mathfrak{p} \}
=
V(f).
$$

<p>
This means the locus of $f$ as a newly defined function is equal to the locus of $f$
as defined by the Zariski topology for schemes.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, with this definition of the evaluation of $f$, we recover the Zariski
topology we have defined as the topology of loci of polynomial functions. Only now,
“functions” are elements of $R$.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the sheaf we have defined is the sheafification of the presheaf of rational
functions when those functions are elements of $R$, exactly as in the affine case,
when the sheaf of regular functions was the sheafification of the presheaf of
rational polynomials.
